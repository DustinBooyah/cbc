            <Text mb="sm">The Michigan Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (MichiCANS) is a powerful tool for understanding what a child and their family truly need and where their strengths lie. It&apos;s more than an assessmentâ€”it&apos;s a shared process that helps teams make informed decisions, set goals and create tailored care plans. By using MichiCANS, professionals can build trust, amplify family voices and track real outcomes over time.</Text>
